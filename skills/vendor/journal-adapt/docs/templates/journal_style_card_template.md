## 1. Writing Identity

**What problems does this corpus value?**
[Describe the type of research questions that appear across the corpus.
Not findings — the type and framing of the questions themselves.]

**What methods signal quality here?**
[What method types appear in the corpus? How rigorous is the formal apparatus?
Is simulation/calibration common? Is empirical evidence expected alongside theory?]

**Disciplinary stance:**
[Is this journal pure economics, management, policy, engineering-adjacent, interdisciplinary?
What disciplines' writing conventions dominate?]

**Implied reader:**
[Academic specialist / policy-informed academic / mixed audience]

## 2. Introduction Conventions

| Observed pattern | Corpus role | Supporting Papers |
|------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| [e.g., Hook = policy-relevant phenomenon, not theoretical puzzle] | primary | paper_001, paper_003, paper_005 |
| [e.g., Contribution stated early, para 2-3] | primary | paper_001, paper_002, paper_004 |
| [e.g., Roadmap is explicit section-by-section] | primary | paper_002, paper_003 |
| [e.g., Literature integrated into intro, not standalone] | primary | paper_001, paper_003, paper_004 |

**Observed intro structure (most common):**
[Describe the typical intro architecture as a sequence of moves]

**What intros in this journal do NOT do:**
- [e.g., No numbered list of contributions]
- [e.g., No "The rest of this paper is organized as follows" opener]

---

## 3. Contribution Expression

| Observed pattern | Corpus role | Supporting Papers |
|------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| [e.g., "we show" voice] | primary | |
| [e.g., Embedded prose, not numbered list] | primary | |
| [e.g., 2-3 contributions, not 4+] | secondary | |

**Preferred contribution format:**
[Describe how contribution statements typically appear]

**Contribution claim strength:**
[How assertive vs hedged are contribution claims in this journal?]

---

## 4. Literature Review

| Observed pattern | Corpus role | Supporting Papers |
|------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| [e.g., Integrated into intro, not standalone section] | primary | |
| [e.g., Organized by theme not chronology] | secondary | |

**How literature is positioned:**
[How do papers in this corpus distinguish themselves from prior work?
What framing is used?]

## 5. Method / Model Norms — PER METHOD FAMILY

> **Split this section by `method_family`** (Method/Results conventions are family-specific and NOT interchangeable). Mark the block matching `manuscript_method_family` as **GOVERNING**. Apply the fallback ladder: (A) family present → governing; (B) family is a corpus minority (small N) → governing but tag `⚠ N small — human review`; (C) family absent → "no in-corpus exemplar; fall back to base_rules apparatus defaults" + flag.

### Family: [family_a] — [GOVERNING / supporting] (N papers)

| Observed pattern | Corpus role | Supporting Papers |
|------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| [e.g., Intuition before formalism] | primary | |
| [e.g., Estimating equation displayed in body; only derivations/proofs in appendix] | primary | |

- Typical `results_main_object`: [..] · `estimating_equation_placement`: [..]

### Family: [family_b] — [supporting] (N papers)

| Observed pattern | Corpus role | Supporting Papers |
|------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| [..] | | |

**Notation density standard:**
[high / moderate / light — and what that looks like in practice]

**Formal exposition style:**
[What does the method section structure typically look like, per family?]

---

## 6. Results and Discussion Norms — PER METHOD FAMILY

> **Split by `method_family`** (same as §5). The GOVERNING block dictates the manuscript's Results convention; do not let a minority family's distinctive presentation become the default.

### Family: [family_a] — [GOVERNING / supporting] (N papers)

| Observed pattern | Corpus role | Supporting Papers |
|------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| [e.g., Coefficient table walked column-by-column, restrictive → rich spec] | primary | |
| [e.g., Mechanism explanation central to results narrative] | primary | |

- Main results object (how the headline is led): [coefficient_table column-walk / figure-led / decomposition / proposition]
- Estimating-equation placement norm: [displayed_in_body / ...]

### Family: [family_b] — [supporting] (N papers)

| Observed pattern | Corpus role | Supporting Papers |
|------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| [e.g., Figures lead, tables confirm (SCM/event-study)] | primary | |

**Governing Results convention for `[manuscript_method_family]`:**
[One-line statement, e.g., "lead with the coefficient table walked column-by-column; display the estimating equation in the body" — from N papers; add `⚠ N small` or `fallback-to-base` if applicable.]

**Discussion function in this journal:**
[What does discussion typically add beyond results?]

**Policy implications scope:**
[How broad / specific / cautious are policy claims?]

## 7. Language Style Profile

| Dimension | Observed norm | Corpus role |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Voice | [active / passive / mixed] | |
| Sentence length | [short / long / varied] | |
| Register | [technical / policy / interdisciplinary] | |
| Hedging level | [low / medium / high] | |
| Mathematical density | [heavy / moderate / light] | |
| Transition style | [explicit / implicit / structural headers] | |

---

## 8. Conflict Table: Corpus Signals vs Static Base Rules

| Dimension | Static Base Rule | Primary Corpus Signal | Secondary Corpus Signal | Winner | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|--------|-------|
| Passive voice | [base norm] | [primary norm] | [secondary norm] | [Primary / Secondary / Base / Tie] | |
| Contribution format | [base norm] | [primary norm] | [secondary norm] | | |
| Hedging | [base norm] | [primary norm] | [secondary norm] | | |
| Lit review placement | [base norm] | [primary norm] | [secondary norm] | | |
| Discussion scope | [base norm] | [primary norm] | [secondary norm] | | |
| Policy language | [base norm] | [primary norm] | [secondary norm] | | |

*This table must be completed by the human reviewer. AI may draft corpus signal columns only.*

## 9. Red Flags (What Likely Hurts Submission)

[List 4–8 writing patterns that are absent from the corpus and likely signal misfit with this journal.
Base on: patterns common in general academic writing but absent here.]

- [e.g., Opening intro with a literature review paragraph]
- [e.g., Numbered lists of 4+ contributions]
- [e.g., Discussion that rehashes results without adding new angle]
- [e.g., Heavy hedging on main findings]

**Apparatus-integrity red flags (MANDATORY when `manuscript_method_family` ∈ {empirical, structural/calibration, mixed}).** Derive from the GOVERNING block's `estimating_equation_placement` / `results_main_object` so the flag and the dynamic-skill hard rule stay in sync:

- Estimating/specification equation NOT displayed in the body (exiled to appendix or absent).
- Main results table (coefficient / decomposition) replaced by a conceptual schematic or matrix rather than supported by it.
- Coefficient/results table relegated to the appendix while a figure or schematic leads the body.

(Pure-theory manuscripts: inapplicable; instead flag any case where the central proposition/derivation is not stated in the body.)
